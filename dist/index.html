        <p class="bold">Dear hiring manager,</p>
        <p>Re: <b><span class="jobTypeSpan">Data Scientist</span> position at <span class="companyNameSpan">COMPANY</span></b></p>
        <p>I am writing to express my interest in the <span class="jobTypeSpan">Data Scientist</span> role at <span class="companyNameSpan">COMPANY</span>. The reason why <span class="companyNameSpan">COMPANY</span><b>'s</b> <span class="jobTypeSpan">Data Scientist</span> role is so appealing to me because I believe that <span class="companyNameSpan">COMPANY</span> represents a strong commitment to innovation and excellence in the industry. My career goal is to advance my expertise in data science and make meaningful contributions in leveraging data-driven insights. </p>
        <p>I believe that I will be an exceptional fit at <span class="companyNameSpan">COMPANY</span> as I have a strong foundation in data science methodologies, algorithms, and frameworks. My previous work experience as a Data Scientist at Stact Tech has helped me foster my understanding and skills in machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, data mining and analysis. Leveraging my knowledge in Python and frameworks such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, Transformers and Scikit-Learn, I have implemented several machine learning and deep learning models with a primary focus on NLP applications, to extract meaningful information from diverse data sources. I have also collaborated with cross-functional teams, including data scientists, developers, and business stakeholders, to develop novel AI solutions.</p>
        <p>I come from a computing background where I pursued my undergraduate study in information technology majoring in data analytics at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). During my time at the university, I worked on various data science projects that involved extracting and transforming data from complex and large datasets using SQL and Python libraries, such as Pandas, Numpy and Scipy. Additionally, I developed predictive models with Python, Matlab, and R, and leveraged tools, such as Tableau and Power BI, to perform data visualisation. Alongside my academic studies, I had the opportunity to gain practical experiences through internships, further honing my skills in data science and expanding my knowledge of real-world applications. By working on various projects and collaborating with multidisciplinary teams, I acquired a comprehensive set of skills and gained a profound understanding of the practical applications of data science in various domains.</p>
        <p>My leadership activities include being a treasurer at PPIA UTS and a project team member at UTS Data Science and AI Society. These roles helped developed my leadership and interpersonal qualities which I believe will be an asset for <span class="companyNameSpan">COMPANY</span> where the ability to work and communicate with multiple stakeholders are crucial.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to having the opportunity to speak with you in more detail about this position and how I could use my skills and knowledge to benefit at your company.</p>
