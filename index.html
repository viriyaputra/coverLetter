        <p><b>Dear hiring manager,</b></p>
        <p>Re: Data Scientist position at %COMPANY%</p>
        <p>I am writing to express my interest in the Data Scientist role at %COMPANY%. The reason why %COMPANY%’s Data Scientist role is so appealing to me because I believe that %COMPANY% represents a strong commitment to innovation and excellence in the industry. My career goal is to advance my expertise in data science and make meaningful contributions in leveraging data-driven insights. </p>
        <p>I believe that I will be an exceptional fit at %COMPANY% as I have a strong foundation in data science. My previous work experience as a Graduate Data Scientist at Stact Tech has helped me foster my understanding and skills in data wrangling, pre-processing, and analysis. Leveraging my knowledge in Python and frameworks such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, Transformers and Scikit-Learn, I have implemented several machine learning and deep learning models with a primary focus on NLP applications, to extract meaningful information from diverse data sources.</p>
        <p>I come from a computing background where I pursued my undergraduate study in information technology majoring in data analytics at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). During my time at the university, I worked on various data science projects that involved extracting and transforming data from complex and large datasets using SQL and Python library. Additionally, I developed predictive models with Python, Matlab, and R, and leveraged tools, such as Tableau and Power BI, to perform data visualisation. Alongside my academic studies, I had the opportunity to gain practical experiences through internships, further honing my skills in data science and expanding my knowledge of real-world applications. By working on various projects and collaborating with multidisciplinary teams, I acquired a comprehensive set of skills and gained a profound understanding of the practical applications of data science in various domains.</p>
        <p>My leadership activities include being a treasurer at PPIA UTS and a project team member at UTS Data Science and AI Society. These roles helped developed my leadership and interpersonal qualities which I believe will be an asset for QBE where the ability to work and communicate with multiple stakeholders are crucial. </p>
        <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to having the opportunity to speak with you in more detail about this position and how I could use my skills and knowledge to benefit your company.</p>
        <p><b>Kind regards,</b></p>
